      [Project thumbnail is a still from Samuel Shanahoy's 2013 film Queen Bee Empire]<br><br>

      Honors Thesis for Wesleyan University's Sociology department, published in Spring of 2019 in conjunction with the release of the collaborative pornographic video project A Long Undressing.

      Abstract


      This text operates under two main frameworks of curiosity: firstly, within the context of a “Hegemony of Optics,” what is the nature of sound and how is this sound related to queerness? Secondly, given this relationship, what elements of sound
      might inform a new approach to pornographic imagery that foregrounds seeking pleasure (rather than solely authentic representations) with receptivity, bottomhood, and other marginalized positionalities in mind? Instead of right-ing the wrongs
      of the perpetually wounding pornographic object through good, liberal representational politics, I would posit that acts of listening and counter-listening unravel the genre just as well as the solitary meaning it is purported to create. I call
      these acts an approach of ‘slutty listening,’ a means leaning into the ear’s openness, of listening to everything without asking everything: “What are you?,” “Who are you?,” “Why are you?” and expecting a singular, legible response. I am drawn
      to sounds that are twinkly, inauthentic, and opaque. I would like to hide behind sound as well as discover something new through it, whether that be a method of looking(-feeling) or a means of conceiving of the bounds of ‘the body’ within three
      dimensional space. This method might be receptive, like an open ear, mouth, vaginal cavity, or anus, and the body unclassifiable and expansive. Maybe, the sounds of a “fake” orgasm on loop, in ejaculatory spurts.

Three of Wands is an experimental 16mm film project conceptualized and filmed in Spring of 2017 at Wesleyan University. Directed by Charlotte Strange, Regina Melady, and Joesph Eusebio. Produced by Kira Newmark and Jacob Sussman. Cinematographer for stills Ian Rice.

Three of Wands is a collaborative experimental film project shot on expired 16mm film and co-directed by three individuals each realizing their own interpretation of a collaboratively produced bare-bones script. Knowing that some or even all of the film would potentially not develop, the directors shot our script three times—leaving the question of whose film would or could be included in the final piece up to chance. In the event that most or all of the film came out (which ended up being the case), we decided to allow the redundant footage to facilitate a non-linear temporal structure for the film in which each of our individual embodiments of the script could come out and the three separate — but intimately intwined – films could relate to one another through a framework of excess and repetition. The original script was also decided using processes of chance, often relying on tarot readings to guide plot points and dialogue. The film includes a clown come-to-life with magic paint, an auction for said-magic paint, a mysterious person, and a seductive angel calling their bluff, "Dying to pick your fruit."

The final video is currently in editing stages, however selected stills from my segment are shown below. I conceptualized the piece, provided art direction, and executed a shotlist while also working closely with a team of crew members to actualize the project in pre-production and on set.
